Why
---

Whilst developing some Java Apps for Mac OS X I was facing the problem of supporting two different kinds of Java versions ‚Äì the old Apple versions and the new Oracle versions.

**Is there some difference, you might ask?** Yes, there is!

1. The installation directory differs:
  * Apple Java 1.5/1.6: `/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/` or `/Library/Java/Home/bin/java`
  * Oracle JRE 1.7/1.8: `/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/`
  * Oracle JDK 1.7/1.8: `/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/`

2. Mac Apps built with tools designed for Apple's Java (like Apple's *JarBundler* or the OpenSource [ANT task "Jarbundler"](https://github.com/UltraMixer/JarBundler)) won't work on Macs with Oracle Java 7 and no Apple Java installed.
  * This is because Apple's `JavaApplicationStub` only works for Apple's Java and their *style* to store Java properties in the `Info.plist` file.
  * To support Oracle Java 7 you would need to built a separate App package with [Oracle's ANT task "Appbundler"](https://java.net/projects/appbundler).
  * Thus you would need the user to know which Java distribution he has installed on their Mac. Not very user friendly...

3. Oracle uses a different syntax to store Java properties in the applications `Info.plist` file. A Java Application packaged as a Mac App with Oracle's Appbundler also needs a different `JavaApplicationStub` and therefore won't work on systems with Apple's old Java...

4. Starting with Mac OS X 10.10 *(Yosemite)*, Java Apps won't open anymore if they contain the *deprecated* Plist dictionary `Java`. This isn't confirmed by Apple, but [issue #9](https://github.com/tofi86/universalJavaApplicationStub/issues/9) leads to this assumption:
  * Apple seems to declare the `Java` dictionary as *deprecated* and ties it to their old Apple Java 6. If you have a newer Oracle Java version installed the app won't open.
  * If Java 7/8 is installed, Apple doesn't accept those java versions as suitable
  * Apple prompts for JRE 6 download even before the `JavaApplicationStub` is executed. This is why we can't intercept at this level and need to replace the `Java` dictionary by a `JavaX` dictionary key.
  * This requires to use the latest [JarBundler](https://github.com/UltraMixer/JarBundler/) version (see below for more details)

TL;DR: Since there is no universally working JavaApplicationStub for Java 6, 7 and above, and because Apple and Oracle really screwed things up during their Java transition phase, I was in need of a new Stub file.
And well, since I can't write such a script in C, C# or whatever fancy language, I wrote it as a Bash script. And it works!
The original script was inspired by [Ian Roberts stackoverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/17546508/1128689). Thanks, Ian!


How the script works
--------------------

You don't need a native `JavaApplicationStub` file anymore. The Bash script needs to be executable ‚Äì that's all.

The script reads JVM properties from `Info.plist` regardless of whether it's Apple or Oracle syntax and passes them to a `exec java` call like the following simplified:

```Bash
# execute Java and set
# - classpath
# - splash image
# - dock icon
# - app name
# - JVM options / properties (-D)
# - JVM default options (-X)
# - main class
# - main class arguments
# - passthrough arguments from Terminal or Drag'n'Drop to Finder icon
exec "${JAVACMD}" \
    -cp "${JVMClassPath}" \
    -splash:"${ResourcesFolder}/${JVMSplashFile}" \
    -Xdock:icon="${ResourcesFolder}/${CFBundleIconFile}" \
    -Xdock:name="${CFBundleName}" \
    ${JVMOptions} \
    ${JVMDefaultOptions} \
    ${JVMMainClass} \
    ${MainArgsArr} \
    ${ArgsPassthru}
```

It sets the classpath, the dock icon, the *AboutMenuName* (as Xdock parameter) and then every *JVMOptions*, *JVMDefaultOptions* or *JVMArguments* found in the `Info.plist` file. See the table below for more supported Plist keys.

The *WorkingDirectory* is either retrieved from Apple's Plist key `Java/WorkingDirectory` or set to the JavaRoot directory within the app bundle.

The name of the *main class* is also retrieved from `Info.plist`. If no *main class* is found, an AppleScript error dialog is shown and the script exits with *exit code 1*.

There is some *foo* happening to determine which Java versions are installed ‚Äì here's the list in which order system properties are checked:

1. System variable `$JAVA_HOME`
  * can also be set to a relative path using the [`<LSEnvironment>` Plist dictionary key](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/LaunchServicesKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001431-106825)
    * which allows for bundling a custom version of Java inside your app!
2. Highest available Java version *(Java 8 trumps 7)* found in one of these locations:
  * `/usr/libexec/java_home` symlinks
  * Oracle's JRE Plugin: `/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Home/bin/java`
  * Symlink for old Apple Java: `/Library/Java/Home/bin/java`
3. If you require a specific to-the-point Java version or a **minimum requirement** with the Plist key `JVMVersion` the script will try to find a matching JDK or JRE in all of the above locations
  * if multiple matching JVM's are found, the script will pick the latest (highest version number)
  * starting from version 3.0 of this script you can use a special syntax in Plist key `JVMVersion` to specify a **max requirement**. See [issue #51](https://github.com/tofi86/universalJavaApplicationStub/issues/51) for examples.

If none of these can be found or executed the script shows an AppleScript error dialog saying that Java needs to be installed:

![Error Dialog No Java Found](/docs/java-error.png?raw=true)

Messages are **localized** and displayed either in English (Default), French, German or Chinese. Language contributions are very welcome! Thank you!


What you need to do
-------------------

Use whichever ANT task you like:
* the opensource ["JarBundler"](https://github.com/UltraMixer/JarBundler) *(recommended)*
  * or my [JarBundler fork](https://github.com/tofi86/Jarbundler) *(deprecated)*
  * _both support the newly introduced and recommended `JavaX` dict key_
* Oracle's opensource ["Appbundler"](https://java.net/projects/appbundler) *(seems to be dead)*
  * or [*infinitekind*'s fork](https://bitbucket.org/infinitekind/appbundler/overview)

Or build the App bundle statically from scratch...

### JarBundler (‚â• v3.3) example
Download the latest JarBundler release [from its github repo](https://github.com/UltraMixer/JarBundler).

:exclamation: **Attention:**
> Using an older version of JarBundler (e.g. [old JarBundler ‚â§ v2.3](http://informagen.com/JarBundler/) or [new JarBundler ‚â§ v3.2](https://github.com/UltraMixer/JarBundler)) might result in [issue #9](https://github.com/tofi86/universalJavaApplicationStub/issues/9) *(Mac OS X 10.10 asking to install deprecated Apple JRE 6 instead of using a newer Java version)*
>
> If you don't want to care about compatibility issues between OS X and Java versions, make sure to use the [latest JarBundler version ‚â• 3.3](https://github.com/UltraMixer/JarBundler/releases)

Then place the `universalJavaApplicationStub` from this repo in your build resources folder and link it in your ANT task (attribute `stubfile`). Don't forget to set the newly introduced `useJavaXKey` option for compatibility:
```XML
<jarbundler
	name="Your-App"
	shortname="Your Application"
	icon="${resources.dir}/icon.icns"
	stubfile="${resources.dir}/universalJavaApplicationStub"
	useJavaXKey="true"
	... >
</jarbundler>
```

The ANT task will take care of all the rest... But of course you can specify more options. Please check the JarBundler docs.

You should get a fully functional Mac Application Bundle working with both Java distributions from Apple and Oracle and all Mac OS X versions.


### Appbundler example
Just place the `universalJavaApplicationStub` from this repo in your build resources folder and link it in your ANT task (attribute `executableName` from [*infinitekind* fork](https://bitbucket.org/infinitekind/appbundler/overview)):
```XML
<appbundler
	name="Your-App"
	displayname="Your Application"
	icon="${resources.dir}/icon.icns"
	executableName="${resources.dir}/universalJavaApplicationStub"
	... >
</appbundler>
```

The ANT task will take care of all the rest... But of course you can specify more options. Please check the Appbundler docs.

You should get a fully functional Mac Application Bundle working with both Java distributions from Apple and Oracle and all Mac OS X versions.


Supported PList keys
--------------------

| Function                                   | Apple PList key        | Oracle PList key      |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| **App Name** (Dock Name)                   | `:CFBundleName`        | `:CFBundleName`       |
| **App Icon** (Dock Icon)                   | `:CFBundleIconFile`    | `:CFBundleIconFile`   |
| **Working Directory**  <sup>üåü</sup>       | `:Java(X):WorkingDirectory`<br/>fallback to `name.app/ | *not supported*<br/>default: `name.app/Contents/Java/` |
| **Java Min/Max<sup>[‚òÖ](https://github.com/tofi86/universalJavaApplicationStub/issues/51)</sup> Version Requirement** | `:Java(X):JVMVersion` | `:JVMVersion` |
| **Java ClassPath** (`-cp ‚Ä¶`) <sup>üåü</sup> | `:Java(X):ClassPath`   | `:JVMClassPath`       |
| **Java Main Class**                        | `:Java(X):MainClass`   | `:JVMMainClassName`   |
| **Splash Image** (`-splash:‚Ä¶`)             | `:Java(X):SplashFile`  | `:JVMSplashFile`      |
| **Java VM Options** (`-X‚Ä¶`) <sup>üåü</sup>  | `:Java(X):VMOptions`   | `:JVMDefaultOptions`  |
| **`-XstartOnFirstThread`** <sup>[‚òÖ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28149634/what-does-the-xstartonfirstthread-vm-argument-do-mean)</sup> | `:Java(X):StartOnMainThread` | *not supported* |
| **Java Properties** (`-D‚Ä¶`) <sup>üåü</sup>  | `:Java(X):Properties`  | `:JVMOptions`         |
| **Main Class Arguments** <sup>üåü</sup>     | `:Java(X):Arguments`   | `:JVMArguments`       |

<sup>üåü</sup> Variable placeholders `$APP_PACKAGE`, `$APP_ROOT`, `$JAVAROOT`, `$USER_HOME` get expanded in these contexts.

### Specify min/max Java requirement

Since v3.0 ([#51](https://github.com/tofi86/universalJavaApplicationStub/issues/51))

Use `Java(X):JVMVersion` (Apple style) or `:JVMVersion` (Oracle style) with the following values:

* `1.8` or `1.8*` for Java 8
* `1.8+` for Java 8 or higher
* `1.7;1.8*` for Java 7 or 8
* `1.8;9.0` for Java 8* up to exactly 9.0 (but not 9.0.*)
* `1.8;9.0*` for Java 8* and 9.0.* but not 9.1.*


### Bundle a JRE/JDK with your app

You can use the Plist key `LSEnvironment` to export and set the `$JAVA_HOME` environment variable relative to your App's root directory:

```xml
<key>LSEnvironment</key>
<dict>
    <key>JAVA_HOME</key>
    <string>Contents/Frameworks/jdk8u232-b09-jre/Contents/Home</string>
<dict>
```


Use a compiled binary for macOS 10.15 and above
-----------------------------------------------

Starting with macOS 10.15 Apple by default prevents access to _Protected Resources_ like the user's _Download_, _Documents_ or _Desktop_ folders and shows a security dialog which the user has to accept before access is granted.

When using `javax.swing.JFileChooser` in your application, which supports these kinds of security dialogs (interestingly `java.awt.FileDialog` does not!), you should use a compiled binary of the `universalJavaApplicationStub` script instead of the plain bash script. See [issue #85](https://github.com/tofi86/universalJavaApplicationStub/issues/85) for more details.

Starting with version 3.1.0 we provide pre-built binaries on the [Releases page](https://github.com/tofi86/universalJavaApplicationStub/releases/) which are automatically compiled with [`shc`](https://github.com/neurobin/shc) via GitHub Actions CI.

Additionaly we recommend you set _Usage Description_ Plist keys as described further below.


Recommended additional Plist keys
---------------------------------

### `NSAppleEventsUsageDescription`

Starting with Mac OS 10.14 users may be confronted with an additional system security dialog before any warning dialog of this stub is shown. See [issue #77](https://github.com/tofi86/universalJavaApplicationStub/issues/77) for more details.

This happens because the warning dialogs of this launcher stub are displayed with AppleScript.

It's recommended to at least set the following Plist key in order to display a descriptive message to the user, why he should grant the app system access:

```xml
<key>NSAppleEventsUsageDescription</key>
<string>There was an error while launching the application. Please click OK to display a dialog with more information or cancel and view the syslog for details.</string>
```

### Access to "Protected Resources"

If your app requires access to _Protected Resources_ like the user's _Download_, _Documents_ or _Desktop_ folders, there are [a couple more properties](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/protected_resources) to add in your Plist file for setting a _Usage Description_: 

* [`NSDownloadsFolderUsageDescription`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nsdownloadsfolderusagedescription)
* [`NSDocumentsFolderUsageDescription`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nsdocumentsfolderusagedescription)
* [`NSDesktopFolderUsageDescription`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nsdesktopfolderusagedescription)
* and maybe more...

This may be extra important when using `javax.swing.JFileChooser` in your application. See [issue #85](https://github.com/tofi86/universalJavaApplicationStub/issues/85) for more details.


Logging
-------

Starting with version 3.0 `universalJavaApplicationStub` logs data to the `syslog` facility which can be easily accessed with the `Console.app` utility by searching for *syslog*:

![Example log data in Console.app](/docs/ConsoleAppLogging.png?raw=true)

Log data includes debug information of the JVM search strategy, App name, language, selected JVM, WorkingDirectory and exec call.


Missing Features
----------------

At the moment, there's no support for
* required JVM architecture (like `x86_64`, etc.)
* prefer JDK over JRE or vice versa
